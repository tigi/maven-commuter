This dataset was published during the first phase of the MTAâ€™s commitment to increasing transparency. We continually examine all our published and publishable data with a view to both providing datasets that can be effectively utilized by our customers and the public at large, and to providing regular, automated updates to these datasets efficiently and sustainably. Consequently, this dataset may be restructured and/or combined with other similar datasets in the future. In February 2023, MTA upgraded the methodology used to calculate the pre-COVID ridership comparison percentages in the dataset. The methodology is now consistent across each agency, more accurate, and less subjective; it uses the 2019 monthly average ridership for non-holiday weekdays, Saturday, and Sunday / holidays and compares each day to the average day of the same type for the equivalent month in 2019. All pre-pandemic comparison numbers in the dataset were refreshed to align with the upgraded methodology.",60000000,55333788.15315855,45228184.28905828,10105603.864100277,r,r,o,44052143.34487311,46474646.18982893,34931057.69194892,36764700.005982205,9121085.652924193,9709946.183846733,#e33636,#f2870c,#e33636,#f2870c,#f2870c,#f2870c
